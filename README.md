## Software

1. Bit Manipulation
  i. Shift and logical operations
  i. Set the 5th bit
  i. Invert every bit (A1)
  i. Clear a bit (A2)
  i. Parsing using argc, argv (A3)
2. Device Drivers
  i. Read from Stdin and write to Stdout
  i. Copy the text from in.txt into out.txt
  i. Read text from echo.txt and write to another file & to Stdout
3. Multi-Processing
  i. Demonstrate the usage of fork()
  i. Create a child process and find the PID of the current and its parent process
  i. Call fork() three times and check the number of processes running (A1)
  i. Create a child process of a child process (A2)
  i. Parent waiting for a specific child process to complete (A3)
4. Signal Function Calls
  i. Manipulation of signal function calls to run a custom function
  i. Ignoring a specific signal function call
5. Multithreading
  i. Creation of 2 threads for reading from Stdin and to convert to uppercase
  i. Using semaphores to prevent undefined behaviour
